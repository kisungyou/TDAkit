Description: Topological data analysis studies structure and shape of the data using topological features. We provide a variety of algorithms to learn with persistent homology of the data based on functional summaries for clustering, hypothesis testing, visualization, and others. We refer to Wasserman (2018) <doi:10.1146/annurev-statistics-031017-100045> for a statistical perspective on the topic.
